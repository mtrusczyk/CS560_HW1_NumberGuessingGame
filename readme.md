## CS560 HW1 Number Guessing Game
### Goal: 
  Create a game named *HW1_NumberGuessingGame* in which a random number between 1 and 100 is generated and the user tries to guess this number. To help user to narrow down the correct answer, the app needs to provide feedback to the user. Specially, the app must have the following:
  * The user must be presented a way to input numerical guesses.
  * The app should provide feedback as to whether the guess made by the user is lower or higher than the correct answer.
  * The app should have a logic in which the game ends (stops asking guesses or continues to accept guesses) when the user guesses the number correctly.
  * The app should keep track and display the number of guesses made by the user (i.e., number of tries).
  * If the user guesses the number correctly, the app should provide a message stating thatthe user has won the game along with the correct answer.
  * There should be a way to start the game over and play again once the game has ended.
